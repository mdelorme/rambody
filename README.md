# This is the Rambody repository

Rambody is the coupling of two legacy astrophysics open-source codes : [RAMSES](https://bitbucket.org/rteyssie/ramses/) and [Nbody6++](https://github.com/nbody6ppgpu/Nbody6PPGPU-beijing).

This coupling allows the resolution of collisional systems such as globular-clusters in collisionless environment such as giant molecular clouds, galaxies or cosmological environment.

*This code is a work in progress*.

# License

All the original parts of both codes are subject to their own licenses. All modifications of the codes for Rambody are to be taken as compliant with their original licenses.

# Usage

## Cloning the repository

The Rambody repository relies on two submodules defined in separate repositories which are the modified version of the two original codes. To start, clone the Rambody repository enabling submodules :

```
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:mdelorme/rambody.git .
```
